Description:
The project is a simple Android Application with a tabbed interface. It allows users to take quizzes, view notes, and watch videos in different tabs. Here's a breakdown of the key components and features:

Tabbed Interface:

The app has a tabbed interface with three tabs: "Quiz," "Notes," and "Video."
Each tab provides different functionality for users.

Quiz Tab:

The "Quiz" tab allows users to take quizzes.
Quiz questions are displayed one at a time with multiple-choice answer options.
Users can select an answer and submit it.
The result (number of correct answers) is displayed at the end of the quiz.

Notes Tab:

The "Notes" tab provides users with educational notes or content.
Notes are displayed in a read-only format, and users can scroll through the content.
Video Tab:

The "Video" tab allows users to watch videos.
A video player is embedded within the tab for viewing video content.

Here is a simple preview of how the app looks:
